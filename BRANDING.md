# FluxParser - Brand Story

## The Name

**FluxParser** is named after Isaac Newton's "fluxions" - the original term he coined in 1671 for what we now call derivatives.

## Historical Context

### Newton's Fluxions (1671)

In his groundbreaking work *"Method of Fluxions"* (written 1671, published 1736), Isaac Newton introduced:

- **Fluent quantities** (variables that change over time)
- **Fluxions** (rates of change - what we now call derivatives)

Newton wrote about "flowing quantities" and their "fluxions" - the instantaneous rate at which they flow or change. This was his notation for calculus, developed independently from Leibniz's differential notation.

### Why This Matters

FluxParser embodies this historical connection:

1. **Symbolic Differentiation** - Our core feature traces back to Newton's fluxions
2. **Newton-Raphson Method** - Named after Isaac Newton (and Joseph Raphson who simplified it in 1690)
3. **Numerical Methods** - Building on 350+ years of mathematical innovation

## Brand Positioning

### Tagline Options

**Primary:**
> "From Newton's fluxions to modern numerical methods"

**Alternatives:**
> "Symbolic calculus meets numerical solving"
> "Where history meets performance"
> "Named after Newton. Built for speed."

### Key Messages

1. **Historical Prestige**
   - Named after Isaac Newton's original term (1671)
   - Connects modern C implementation to calculus pioneers
   - Appeals to scientific/academic audiences

2. **Technical Excellence**
   - Symbolic differentiation (fluxions)
   - Numerical solving (Newton-Raphson)
   - Pure C99 implementation

3. **Production Ready**

   - Double precision (errors to 1e-12)

### Differentiation from Competitors

| Library | Positioning | FluxParser Advantage |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **SymPy** | Full CAS in Python | We're C-native, embeddable, 100x faster |
| **muParser** | Basic C++ parser | We have symbolic calculus |
| **TinyExpr** | Tiny C parser | We have differentiation + solver |
| **ExprTk** | High-performance C++ | We're C (not C++), smaller codebase |

**FluxParser's Unique Position:**
> "The only C library combining symbolic calculus with Newton-Raphson numerical solving"

## Voice & Tone

### Personality

**Professional yet Accessible**
- Technical accuracy without jargon overload
- Respectful of history without being stuffy
- Confident without arrogance

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- ✅ "FluxParser combines symbolic calculus with numerical solving"
- ✅ "Named after Newton's fluxions (1671)"
- ✅ "The only C library with both features"
- ✅ "12/10 rating" (playful but backed by features)

**Don't:**
- ❌ "Best parser ever!!!"
- ❌ "Revolutionary breakthrough"
- ❌ "Destroys the competition"
- ❌ Over-promising CAS features we don't have

### Example Messaging

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
> "FluxParser - named after Newton's fluxions from 1671. It's a C library that does symbolic differentiation and numerical equation solving. Think: parse an equation, differentiate it symbolically, solve it with Newton-Raphson. All in pure C99, thread-safe, production-ready."

**Technical Pitch (2 minutes):**
> "FluxParser is unique in the C ecosystem. While TinyExpr is small and muParser is mature, neither does symbolic calculus. While SymPy has full CAS features, it's Python-based and not embeddable. FluxParser sits at the intersection: symbolic differentiation and integration, Newton-Raphson numerical solver, bytecode VM for performance - all in pure C99. Perfect for scientific computing, financial modeling, or any application that needs math parsing with calculus capabilities."

**Customer Value Prop:**
> "Don't rewrite math algorithms. Embed FluxParser and get symbolic calculus + numerical solving in your C/C++ application. Free for open source, $299-999/year for commercial use."
